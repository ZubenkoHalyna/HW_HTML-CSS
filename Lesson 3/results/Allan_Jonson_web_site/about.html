        <h2> Welcome to Your Path of Personal Growth</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Allan Jonson, and I am a certified personal life coach dedicated to helping individuals
            like you unlock their full potential. My mission is to provide you with the tools, guidance, and support

        <h2> My Journey to Becoming a Life Coach</h2>
        <p> My passion for personal development began 10 years ago when I experienced my own transformative journey.
            After overcoming burnout in my corporate career, navigating a major life transition, and addressing
            long-standing self-doubt, I realized the power of self-awareness and intentional growth. This inspired me to
            pursue certifications in Positive Psychology Coaching, Cognitive-Behavioral Coaching, and Mindfulness-Based
            Stress Reduction and dedicate my career to helping others achieve their dreams.
        </p>
